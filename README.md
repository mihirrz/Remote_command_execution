# Remote_command_execution

C++ remote command execution system for remote command execution.

This project is a remote command execution system developed using the C++ programming language. It features a simple client-server model for a command-line interface that allows the client to remotely execute commands on the server and receive the output.
The system leverages the robust features of C++ to ensure high performance and reliability, making it an ideal solution for organizations that need to remotely manage their IT infrastructure. It also serves as a starting point for building more complex networked applications, as it demonstrates the basics of socket programming and inter-process communication.
This project aims to provide a much-needed solution to the problem of slow or unreliable remote command execution, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of IT infrastructure management for organizations.
To use this system, simply clone the repository and follow the instructions in the README file to build and run the client and server applications.
